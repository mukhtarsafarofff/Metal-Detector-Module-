We can find a metal detector at airports, theaters and various other public places. They are used for the safety of people to detect anyone carrying a metal.  In this project I am  going to design a simple metal detector circuit. There are so many metal detector designs but most of them are complex in design so here I am going to design a simple metal detector circuit using 555 Timer IC. In this circuit if the inductance value changes the value of reactance or impedance changes. The 555 IC timer here acts as a square wave generator and it generate pulses with frequencies audible to human. The capacitor between pin2 and pin1 should not be changed as it is need to generate audible frequencies. In this circuit you can see RLC circuit. RLC circuit is the metal detection part here.
