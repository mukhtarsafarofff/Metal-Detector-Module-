We can find a metal detector at airports, theaters and various other public places. They are used for the safety of people to detect anyone carrying a metal.  In this project I am  going to design a simple metal detector circuit. There are so many metal detector designs but most of them are complex in design so here I am going to design a simple metal detector circuit using 555 Timer IC.
